Tidarr provides now files to `/shared/nzb_downloads` folder.

- **Quality naming change**: "master" quality renamed to "max" (24-bit 192kHz)
- **Configuration format**: Migrated from JSON to TOML format
  - Old: `config/tiddl.json`
  - New: `config/.tiddl/config.toml` + `config/.tiddl/auth.json`
- **Path templates changed**: Review and adjust your previous settings (quality, paths, templates)
- **Favorites download disabled**: Download/sync all favorite albums/tracks/playlists is disabled and will reimplemented in time by Tiddl team.

### 🎉 Features

### 🔧 Technical Changes

### 🔄 Migration Notes
